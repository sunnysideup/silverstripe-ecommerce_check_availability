
E-commerce Availability Check
================================================================================

This module allows you to create orders that need
to be checked for availability.  For example - people
book a cottage, but before it is confirmed, the shop
owner needs to check that the cottage is available.

This means that people can place an order but with
the caveat that the order needs to be confirmed.

Once they have placed the order, the shop admin can
review the order and (a) cancel it (b) adjust it
(c) accept it.
